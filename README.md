Created a repository for my first Java Spring Boot application. 
I will be building a RESTful Web Service from [this](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service) website.

We can finish out the code by testing out the service. 
Since I'm using maven, i can run the application by using the following:
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run 

Then in the web browser I can head over to
> http://localhost:8080/greeting

and see that we get the following:
> {"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
